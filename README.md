Toward a new level of modeling of environmental effects on galaxies
===================================================================

This is the source of my thesis.

A more detailed description on how to compile sources and how to use the
template will be added as soon as possible. Some commentaries are useful in
the source.

On non powerful stations, the compilation time can be very high (one or two
minutes) and less than 20 seconds for last generation of CPU.
