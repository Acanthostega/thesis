\section{Introduction}
%
A mock catalogue is a useful tool to test algorithms involving galaxies in
order to see if it is operational in a realistic situation. Many of the
properties of galaxy surveys can be simulated: the spatial clustering of
galaxies, luminosity function, incompleteness and measures errors are some
examples of them. There are different methods to obtain such a mock catalogue.
All of them involves cosmological simulations and there halos of dark matter.
According to the model of galaxy formation, we can use halo occupation
distribution (HOD) to populate dark matter haloes with galaxies and putting
some luminosity functions (for example) as constraints. We can follow galaxies
in semi-analytical models (SAM) in those cosmological simulations outputs in
order to have statistical properties of galaxies which agree with observational
results. With such realistic galaxies, we can use those simulation boxes to
place an observer into it, and create a mock survey. But to have a realistic
mock catalogue, it's necessary to take care of many things which will be
described in the next section.
%
\section{Mock structure}
%
In all this section, we will assume that we have already in our possession a
dark matter simulation box which has been populated with galaxies with one of
the methods described below (SAM, HOD\ldots). At this step, physical properties
of those galaxies aren't interesting.
%
\subsection{Placing boxes}
%
The first step to make a mock catalogue is to get galaxies positions like in a
survey, to get an $(\alpha,\delta)$ frame to simulate the sky coverage of
survey and, at the same time, project galaxies on the sky, masking to us some
spatial modulations of galaxy properties.

We want that a false observer see the same volume extension of a true survey.
For example for the SDSS survey, we can measure redshift to a value of 0.3 (and
more!). But the problem is that the majority of the simulation boxes have a
size of around $L_{\mathrm{box}}=100-300 h^{-1}$ Mpc, letting us with a maximal
redshift in our false survey of around ${H_0}{L_{\mathrm{box}}}/c\approx 0.025$
in the case of a box of $100 h^{-1}$ Mpc sized. Bigger simulations exist, and
maybe can allow us to access to bigger redshifts, but this increasing size
reduces the resolution of the simulation in particle mass and therefore we
can't have low mass halos in the simulations.

The solution is to take a ``little'' simulation box and to replicate it and to
make some bigger ``Tetris'' cube until we reach the maximal redshift we want.
An example of the resulting ``mock cube'' is shown on figure
(\ref{fig:cubemock}).
%
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/mock/mock}
    \caption{The structure of the mock catalog once we have replicated the
        simulation box chosen to populate dark matter halos. Each cube
        represents a simulation box whose galaxies where randomly
        transformed in their positions. Placing an observer at a given
        position, we can access different geometry for the survey and go to
    higher redshift ranges.\label{fig:cubemock}}%
\end{figure}

Now if we take an observer at some position into this big box, we can have
different sky coverage for the observer. The simplest is to place the observer
at a corner, which gives a solid angle of $\pi/2$ steradians. At the centre,
we have a full sky coverage but we reduce the redshift extension by 2.

If we want to care about redshift evolution of galaxies for the observer, we
need to use other snapshots at different redshifts. Box sizes are similar in
comoving coordinates, and different in physical coordinates due to the
variation of the Hubble constant with redshift ($h$ depends en $z$). But we
can simply join cubes in comoving coordinates, facilitating the computation
of the mock catalogue. Indeed, the cosmological redshift of the galaxy, only
consequence of the Hubble flow, can be solved from the relation between the
redshift and the comoving distance, equals to the comoving transverse
distance (or proper motion distance) in the case of a flat Universe
($\Omega_k=0$). Moreover, the comoving separation $R$ between two points
with angular separation $\theta$ on the sky, at comoving distance $D_c$ from
the observer, are simply related by a geometrical relation $R=\theta D_c$.
This separation $\theta$ deduced from comoving coordinates should be the
same as those of the observer if he knows perfectly the cosmological
redshift of galaxies. The observer wants to know the physical separation
$R_p$ between the two galaxies, so $R_p=\theta d_\mathrm{ang}$ giving
$R_p \left(1+z\right)= R_p/a\left(t\right)=R_c=\theta D_c$.
%

Placing boxes as described previously can creates a perspective effect from the
point of view of an observer, and the consequences aren't predictable in a
statistical sense when we try to use the mock catalog. To avoid this, we apply
some transformations on galaxies in the initial cube like inversions, rotations
and periodic translations. Rotations are multiples of $\pi/2$ around the three
principal coordinates axes, because if other rotations are allowed, this can
create some over-densities in some regions of the final mock which aren't
physical. Translations are performed on the three principal axes
and when galaxies are out of the initial cube, periodic conditions are applied.
All of those transformations are randomly generated for each cube in the final
mock catalogue.
%
\subsection{Physics}
%
\subsubsection{Celestial coordinates}
%
The first step to simulate this is to transform Cartesian coordinates in the
3D space to celestial coordinates ($(\alpha,\delta)$ frame). Getting these
coordinates is the same as computing spherical coordinates.
%
\begin{equation}
    \alpha=\left\{ \begin{array}{lcr}
     \mbox{arctan2}(Y,X)+2\pi & \mbox{if} & Y>0 \\
     \mbox{arctan2}(Y,X) & \mbox{else} & \\
    \end{array}\right.\nonumber%
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
    \delta=\mbox{sign}(Z)\arccos\left(\frac{\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}}{\sqrt{X^2+Y^2+Z^2}}\right)
\end{equation}
%
\subsubsection{Redshifts}
%
In our case, the origin of coordinates is the observer. If we keep the distance
as calculated previously, the observer can still have precise determination of
the distance of a galaxy. In reality, we observe it in redshift space so the
redshift as distance indicator is biased by peculiar velocities. Our initial
galaxy catalog allow us to get the velocity of a galaxy, so we can compute the
line of sight (los) velocity of this galaxy relatively to the observer.
%
\begin{equation}
    v_{\mathrm{los}}=\cfrac{\vec{OG}.\vec{v_{\mathrm{pec}}}}{||\vec{OG}||}
\end{equation}
%
where $O$ is the observer and $G$ the galaxy, $\vec{v_{\mathrm{pec}}}$ its
peculiar velocity. This velocity has a sign. The redshift is just the
expression a shift in wavelength due to a velocity. The observed wavelength
$\lambda$ is linked to the original (emitted) wavelength $\lambda_0$ by:
%
\begin{equation}
    \lambda=(1+z)\lambda_0
\end{equation}
%
The shift caused by Universe expansion is
$\lambda_{\cos}=(1+z_{\cos})\lambda_0$ where the subscript $\cos$ refer to
the cosmological expansion. The shift caused by the peculiar velocity is
$\lambda=(1+z_{\mathrm{pec}})\lambda_{\cos}$. So the observed wavelength is
$\lambda=(1+z_{\mathrm{pec}})(1+z_{\cos})\lambda_0$. The resulting observed
redshift is just:
%
\begin{equation}
    (1+z)=(1+z_{\mathrm{pec}})(1+z_{\cos})
\end{equation}
%
The peculiar redshift is the just due to the relativist Doppler effect:
%
\begin{equation}
    (1+z_{\mathrm{pec}})=\sqrt{\cfrac{1+\beta}{1-\beta}}
\end{equation}
%
with $\beta={v_{\mathrm{los}}}/{c}$. The cosmological redshift is
approximated by $z_{\cos}={H_0}{D}/c$ where $D$ is the physical distance of
the galaxy to the observer and $H_0$ the Hubble constant.
%
\comments{I think we need to add the velocity of the Local Group in the
redshift, because in our case the observer has a null velocity. Maybe
corrected in SDSS data?}
%
Applying this method to mock catalogue, we can have galaxies whose distance
is biased by peculiar velocities in redshift space. With such a treatment,
the velocity dispersion of galaxies in groups leads to the apparition of
``fingers of God'' as seen in observations in redshift space.
%
\subsubsection{Survey mask}
%
With our frame in redshift space relative to the observer, we can apply
different masks on angular coordinates according to the survey we want to
mimic. An example of such a mask is in appendix (\ref{ap:sdss}).
%
\subsubsection{K-corrections}
%
In reality, an observer study galaxies in a given bandwidth in wavelength and
can't use the bolometric flux of the object. With the expanding Universe, all
the spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxy is shifted. All wavelengths
are shifted by the same value for a given redshift. So, knowing the luminosity
$L$ of a galaxy in a given band in reality (using the true SED), computing its
apparent magnitude for an observer isn't as easy as correcting for the distance
modulus. The observer in the same band sees a different part of the true SED\@.
The flux observed in the same band as the true flux is maybe higher or lower. A
correction for this effect is needed and must be taken into account in our mock
catalogue.

As explained before, this correction depends on the SED of galaxies and the
band used in the survey. The common way of correcting, it when we have a
multi-band photometry, is to fit the observed SED in those bands with
theoretical templates of SEDs. Such templates can be obtained with existing
programs as PEGASE \comments{Add references}, which give us SEDs with some
assumptions on the galaxy. But those programs are a little time consuming,
which can be a problem for mock when we want to run several of them. A good
solution is provided by \citet{Chilingarian+10}, where the K-correction is
fitted on templates for SED as given by PEGASE in terms of a polynomial of the
redshift of the galaxy and its colour. The corresponding K-correction is
precise for redshifts until 0.3 in different survey bands (including $ugriz$
for the SDSS). This work reduces the computation of K-corrections to the use of
simple polynomial relations and make our task easier.

By definition, the K-correction $K$ for a galaxy of apparent magnitude $m_X$
in a given band $X$ and absolute magnitude $M_X$ in the same band is:
%
\begin{equation}
    {m_X}={M_X} + {5\log_{10}\left({d_{\mathrm{lum}}\left[pc\right]}\right)} - 5 + K
\end{equation}
%
In our case, the K-correction depends on the redshift of the galaxy and its
colour in apparent magnitude given two bands. So we can rewrite:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:appmag}
    m_X = M_X + 5\log_{10}\left({d_{\mathrm{lum}}\left[pc\right]}\right) - 5 + K( z, m_X - m_{X'} )
\end{equation}
%
where:
%
\begin{equation}
    K(z,m_{X}-{m}_{X'})=\sum_{i=0}^{N_i}\sum_{j=0}^{N_j}{a_{ij}}{z^i}{{(m_X-{m}_{X'})}^j}
\end{equation}
%
and $a_{ij}$ is a ${N_i}\times{N_j}$ matrix containing the coefficients of the
two dimensional polynomial. These coefficients depend on the bands of the
survey used for the colour computation.

The observer in the mock can just, in theory, access to apparent magnitude
of the survey. But we don't know in advance these magnitudes, and as we can
see in the expression of equation (\ref{eq:appmag}), we need apparent
magnitudes to compute apparent magnitudes. If we use the other bands of the
survey, with $a_{ij}$ coefficients, we can always write a set of equations
for a galaxy which involves all apparent magnitudes of the survey. So we can
write a set of non linear equations with polynomial of order $N_j$ (redshift
of the galaxy is supposed to be known). Numerically it's easy to solve this
set of equations, and relatively fast with equations solvers or by
iterations. In practice, the first is faster than the second method, even if
both methods give similar results in apparent magnitudes.
%
\subsubsection{Flux limit}
%
We have seen in appendix (\ref{ap:sdss}) that spectroscoped galaxies are just
defined for galaxies whose apparent magnitude is less than 17.77 in $r$
band. So, in all the redshift sample, we miss some galaxies not sufficiently
bright. To take into account this effect, we remove galaxies not reaching
the limit apparent magnitude of the survey.
\comments{Some surveys have variation of this flux limit with the sky
position. Maybe something like this to check for SDSS?}
%
\subsubsection{Spectroscopic and photometric redshifts}
%
Sometimes, we can't access to spectroscopic redshifts which are more precise
than photometric redshifts. In the SDSS, for example, this is due to tiling
process. Fibers analysing the spectrum of galaxies can't be closer from each
other than 55'', so if for a target galaxy (selected to get a spectrum)
there is an other galaxy closer than those 55'', the tile containing all fibers
doesn't have the possibility to measure the redshift of this galaxy. This
problem is more significant for dense regions in the celestial plane. A very
good algorithm to placing tiles in order to limit the number of missed galaxies
(\textit{ie} the number of fiber collision) has been applied in the galaxy
sample of the SDSS\@.
%
\note{Cite Blanton or Lupton!}.
%
But there is still some galaxies without spectroscoped
redshifts. If we remove those galaxies from our sample, there will be a
spectroscopic incompleteness with unknown effects on our results.

%
\subsubsection{Observational errors}
%
\note{Errors exist in redshift measurement, photometry, astrometry\ldots We
add them in our mock catalogue by simply assuming a distribution for errors
around the true value, and then applying it to the galaxy in our mock
catalogue.}
%
\comments{Think in a way of adding the surface brightness selection
criterion on the mock catalogue. It will be great!}.
